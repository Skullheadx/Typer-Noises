I'm so sick of all these people who think they're gamers. No, you're not. Most of you are not even close to being gamers. I see these people saying "I put well over 100hrs in this game and it's great!" That's nothing, most of us can easily put 300+ in all of our games. I see people who only have the Nintendo switch and claim to be gamers. Come talk to me when you pick up a keyboard and mouse then we'll be friends.
